**Research interest:** (See this [page](https://jd92.wang/research/) for more details)
- * exact and heuristic algorithms for routing problems, especially for orienteering problems.
- * integration of traditional optimization algorithms and machine learning.

I am currently an Associate Researcher at the Chinese Academy of Military Science in Beijing, and also working as a visiting scholar in Great Bay University in Doguan, Guangdong province, China. My research lies in the field of Operations Research, with a focus on developing exact, heuristic and machine learning algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, including routing, network optimization, and scheduling. The applicaitons of these theorical techniques includes the Earth observation satellite scheduling, Orienteering problems, truck/drone routing and delivery.

I received my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering from the College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), under the supervision of Prof. Lining Xing, in December 2020. From September 2017 to October 2019, I was a Visiting Researcher at the Mobility Research Center (CIB) of KU Leuven, Belgium, where I worked with Prof. Pieter Vansteewegen. Prior to my Ph.D., I earned both a Master’s and a Bachelor’s degree in Management Science and Engineering from NUDT.

My doctoral research focused on heuristic and exact algorithm design for Agile Earth Observation Satellite (AEOS) scheduling, which I modeled as novel variants of the Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW). In particular, I explored extensions of OPTW that incorporate time-dependent travel times and rewards, addressing the dynamic and constrained nature of real-world satellite mission planning. My current and future research interests include reinforcement learning for dynamic routing problems, data-driven dynamic programming and heuristics for routing problems, and truck-drone cooperative routing optimization. Optimization issues for complex systems and networks are also my leisure interests. Until now，I have published my work on EJOR, COR, IEEE SMC and other journal papers in the field of Operations Research, and serve as a reviewer for several journals in operations research and aerospace applications, including Computers & Operations Research, Computers & Industrial Engineering, and Advances in Space Research.
